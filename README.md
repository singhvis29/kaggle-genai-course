### Notebook Summary

#### Notebook 1 - Prompting
1. LLM output can be obtained using Google's new google-genai python SDK.
2. models.generate_content is an API which is used to obtain the LLM response. We can pass parameters like prompt, model name (e.g. - gemini-2.0-flash), configuration of response etc.).
3. We can start a chat using chats.create API, this will create a multi-turn structure of the interation with LLM. We can also input a chat history when we initiate the chat to provide a context to the chat.
4. LLM response can be configured multiple ways e.g. -
  * max_output_tokens: limit output length
  * temperature: control randomness in response
  * top-p: control diversity in response
5. Gemini API has an Enum mode feature that allows you to constrain the output to a fixed set of values
6. config parameter in the models.generate_content API can also be used to specify an output format (e.g.- json). This can be obtained by passing response_schema parameter in the config file
7. Chain of thought response can be obtained by adding prompts like - "think step by step"
8. We can run a ReAct prompt directly in the Gemini API and perform the searching steps yourself. As this prompt follows a well-defined structure, there are frameworks available that wrap the prompt into easier-to-use APIs that make tool calls automatically, such as the LangChain.
9. To capture a single step at a time, while ignoring any hallucinated Observation steps, you will use stop_sequences to end the generation process. The steps are Thought, Action, Observation, in that order.
10. models.generate_content_stream API can be used to initiate "thinking mode" in Gemini 2.0 flash model, "Thinking" model has been trained to generate the "thinking process" the model goes through as part of its response, using a "thinking mode" model can provide you with high-quality responses without needing specialised prompting like the previous approaches.
11. Gemini also has features to help with coding such as - generating, executing, and explaning code.
